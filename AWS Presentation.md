## AWS Introduction/Demo

### What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering **compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality** to help businesses scale and grow.

### What are important AWS Services that we need to know 

#### Route53

[**Route53**](http://aws.amazon.com/route53)  is a highly available, scalable, and feature rich domain name service (DNS) web service. Route53 can even register your domain name.

#### Identity and Access Management

[**IAM**)](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/)  provides enhanced security and identity management for your AWS account. In addition, it allows you to enable “multi factor” authentication to enhance the security of your AWS account.

#### Simple Storage Service

[**S3**](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)  is a flexible, scalable, and highly available storage web service. Payment model for S3 is “pay as you go” so you’ll only be billed for the amount of data you store and how much bandwidth you use to transfer it in and out.

#### Elastic Compute Cloud

[**EC2**](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)   provides flexible, on-demand computing resources with a “pay as you go” pricing model. 

#### Elastic Block Store

[Elastic block store (EBS)](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/)  provides persist storage volumes that attach to EC2 instances to allow you to persist data past the lifespan of a single EC2. 

#### CloudWatch

[CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)  provides monitoring for AWS resources including EC2 and EBS. CloudWatch enables administrators to view and collect key metrics and also set a series of alarms to be notified in case of trouble.
